# DataAlgoQuest

DataAlgoQuest (DAQ) is designed to tackle the difficulties students often encounter when learning about data structures. Traditional teaching methods, like blackboard lessons, can leave many students feeling unclear. DAQ will offer an interactive, student-friendly, single-page application, developed using MEAN and MERN stacks, where users can explore data structures and algorithms through engaging visualizations, quizzes, and coding challenges. DAQ is a comprehensive visualization of data structures and algorithms, aiming to make learning more hands-on and accessible for students.
